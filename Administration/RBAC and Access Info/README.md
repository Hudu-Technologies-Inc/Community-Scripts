Auditing RBAC, Password Folder Access, and Public Articles
It's always important to audit access levels and public data, especially when dealing with large swaths of client data or new access control features.

There are several angles to consider - user permissions, group permissions, public articles, password folders, but this handy script can be a useful way to visualize some of these potential areas of improvement.

If you are a 'Totally Tabular' kind of user, this is just the tool for you- the results export to a few handy csv's for any drilldown or analysis needed (no actual passwords included in these tables).

RBAC Passwords / Folders Section
tables included:

Per-user password/folder access and membership details

Group-accessibility counts

RBAC passwords per-company/per-folder

Per-user accessible passwords count

group associations for all RBAC-enabled passwords

---
All Passwords / Scope Section
Tables included:

All Password Details scope, RBAC, name and company

password / scope / company comparison

Which companies have more passwords with/without RBAC

---

Articles Section
Public Articles overview - just a simple table of article name, public url, and company. (if no company is present, it is a Central/Global Knowledge Base article).

Generally, it's good to ensure that these article names should reflect its contents. Too-general of article names could lead to confusion during management.
